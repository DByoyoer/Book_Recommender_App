# CPSC 491 Capstone - Book Recommender

Author: Michael Morikawa

## Installation
### APK 
If you simply need to install the app on an Android device or emulator than go to the latest [release](https://github.com/DByoyoer/Book_Recommender_App/releases/latest) and download the provided apk and install the apk as you normally would.

### Build and Run Using Android Studio
1. Install Android Studio, this project was built using Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.1.1 Patch 2 and can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive). The project has not been built using the latest Android Studio release so I am unsure if it will build properly.
2. Follow [this](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) Android Developer's guide to setup and run the application on a virtual device.
3. When clicking run make sure that the dropdown next to the virtual device dropdown has the correct module selected (should just be 'app')
4. After clicking run the application should build and then be launched on the virtual device.
